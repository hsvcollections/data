"What does project planning involve?","Project planning involves defining clear, discrete activities and the work needed to complete each activity within a single project. It often requires you to make numerous assumptions about the availability of resources such as hardware, software, and personnel. It is much easier to plan nearer-term activities than those occurring in the future. In actual fact, you often have to construct longer-term plans that are more general in scope and nearer-term plans that are more detailed. The repetitive nature of the project management process requires that plans be constantly monitored throughout the project and period.","","","","Project planning involves defining clear, discrete activities and the work needed to complete each activity within a single project.

"Define and describe the PERT technique.","PERT (Program Evaluation Review Technique; Concept) is a technique that uses optimistic, pessimistic, and realistic time estimates to calculate the expected time for a particular task. This technique can help you to obtain a better time estimate when there is some uncertainty as to how much time a task will require to be completed. The optimistic (o) and pessimistic (p) times reflect the minimum and maximum possible periods of time for an activity to be completed. The realistic (r) time, or most likely time, reflects the project manager's "best guess" of the amount of time the activity actually will require for completion. Once each of these estimates is made for an activity, an expected time (ET) can be calculated. Because the expected completion time should be closest to the realistic (r) time, it is typically weighted four times more than the optimistic (o) and pessimistic (p) times. Once you add these values together, it must be divided by six to determine the ET. This equation is shown in the following formula:
ET = (o + 4r + p)/6 where ET = expected time for the completion for an activity; o = optimistic completion time for an activity; r = realistic completion time for an activity; p = pessimistic completion time for an activity.","","","","PERT (Program Evaluation Review Technique; Concept) is a technique that uses optimistic, pessimistic, and realistic time estimates to calculate the expected time for a particular task.

"What is the critical path? Why is it important?","The critical path of a network diagram is represented by the sequence of connected activities that produce the longest overall time period. All nodes and activities within this sequence are referred to as being "on" the critical path. The critical path represents the shortest time in which a project can be completed. In other words, any activity on the critical path that is delayed in completion delays the entire project.
